## Class Performance Analysis

The analysis indicates a balanced distribution of learner performance across
Exceeding, Meeting, and Approaching Expectations.

- Two learners consistently exceed expectations across most learning areas.
- Two learners meet expectations and demonstrate stable academic progress.
- Two learners require targeted support, particularly in language-based subjects.

Overall strengths are observed in Mathematics, Integrated Science, and Creative Arts.
Focused remediation and differentiated instruction are recommended to improve
outcomes for all learners.


## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. Provide enrichment opportunities for high-performing learners.
2. Offer targeted remediation in languages and humanities.
3. Use continuous assessment feedback to monitor learner progress.
4. Apply differentiated instruction strategies aligned with CBC principles.

This notebook demonstrates how data-driven analysis can support effective
CBC reporting and learner development.
